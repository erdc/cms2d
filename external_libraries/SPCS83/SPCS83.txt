!     SPCS83 - Version 2.1 From National Geodetic Survey
!                    February, 2002
!
!     This modules contains all the subroutines needed to convert
!     NAD 83 state plane coordinates to NAD 83 geographic positions
!     and conversely. Includes defining constants for NAD 83
!     coordinate zones. State plane coordinates are entered or 
!     computed to 1 mm accuracy, while the latitudes and longitudes
!     entered or computed correspond to approximately 0.3 mm
!     accuracy.
!
!    All subroutines were taken from the spcs83 package :
!
!    tblspc.for      drgppc_v2.for      drpcgp_v2.for
!    lconst.for      lamr1.for          tconpc.for
!    tmgeod.for      skewr.for          oconst.for
!    lamd1.for       tconst.for         tmgrid.for
!    skewd.for
!
!    routines with *_v2.for were modified for input contents only.
