                           XMDF Release Notes

     This file describes changes introduced into XMDF with each release.
     
     Note that VisualStudio 8 is required for building, Fortran is
     required for some builds, Doxygen is required for some builds to
     recreate documentation.  Release DLLs are provided pre-built.

\\\\\\
FIXES:
\\\\\\

- Probably many more undocumented changes in source control.

\\\\\\
FIXES:
\\\\\\

- Change HDF5 from 1.6.6 to 1.8.1 for 64-bit support.

- Remove Fortran 11.0 optimization because it crashes when returning from 
  xfgetnumopenidentifiers_f
  
- Changed to hsize_t not int to avoid data loss within XMDF

- Deprecated Detect64BitPortabilityProblems.

- Define H5_USE_16_API in H5version.h to avoid additional changes just yet.

Version 1.5 internal release for WMS 8.1

Version 1.4 7-Mar-2008 changes since 03-Oct-2006.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\
NEW FEATURES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

- Undocumented functions were added to the public interface.

- No longer includes a multi-platform Unix build process.

- Includes prebuilt Win32 release DLLs of all libraries.

- Includes sources and projects in the VS solution for other required libraries
  such as HDF5.

\\\\\\\\\\
BUG FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\

- Documentation was improved in some areas.

================================================================

\\\\\\\\\\\\\
NEW FEATURES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

- Now includes a multi-platform Unix build process.

- Includes precompiled HDF5 1.6.5 libraries for Mac, CrayXT3, and IRIX.

\\\\\\\\\\
BUG FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\

- Documentation was corrected in some areas.

================================================================

Changes since 20December2005 to XMDF version 1.2

\\\\\\\\\\\\\
NEW FEATURES:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Upgraded for compatibility to HDF5 version 1.6.5.  This version of XMDF should not be used with older versions of HDF5.

Added timestep deletion. Added the function xfSetDatasetNumTimes to override the actual number of timesteps stored in the file.

Added a reference directory of test output files.


\\\\\\\\\\
BUG FIXES:
\\\\\\\\\\

The library was designed to use 1 based indices.  The following functions were using 0 based indices and have been converted to 1 based indices:
xfReadScalarValuesTimestep
xfReadActivityTimestep
xfReadScalarValuesAtIndex
xfReadVectorValuesTimestep
xfReadActivityValuesAtIndex

It seems there was a change to how HDF5 treats the function H5Topen.  Accordingly the following functions were changed.  This should not impact library users.
xfGetLibraryVersion
xfGetPropertyStringLength
xfReadPropertyString

Changed the Fortran versions of xfReadActivityTimestep, xfReadActivityValuesAtIndex, and xfReadVectorValuesAtIndex to translate correctly from 1 based to 0 based array indices.

Changed various Fortran function arguments from OUT to IN.

Changed char* conversions from Fortran functions to terminate the strings using the Fortran string length argument.
